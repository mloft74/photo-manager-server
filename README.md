# Photo Manager Server

Photo Manager Server is a server to upload and host photos for use with a [Roku screensaver](https://github.com/mloft74/roku_local_photos). Photos can be managed through an [app](https://github.com/mloft74/photo-manager-client).

## Deploying

The server uses Docker Compose as a deployment mechanism. Simply run `docker compose up -d` to deploy the server in the background. You may need to use the `--build` flag if deploying an update.
